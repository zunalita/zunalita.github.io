    <h2 id="who-we-are">1. Who We Are</h2>
    <p>
        We are Zunalita Blog, a platform dedicated to delivering high-quality
        digital content designed to inspire and inform readers worldwide. Our
        mission is to create a safe, engaging, and respectful environment where
        users can share, learn, and collaborate. We are committed to
        transparency, privacy, and continuous improvement to meet the needs of
        our community.
    </p>
    <p>
        Our team is focused on maintaining reliability and openness in all
        aspects of our blog. We welcome feedback and encourage readers to
        communicate suggestions or concerns, helping us grow and provide better
        content. These Terms of Service guide how we operate and interact with
        our users, fostering mutual respect and clear expectations.
    </p>

    <h2 id="age-requirements">
        2. Age Requirements and Responsibility of Parents and Guardians
    </h2>
    <p>
        To use our services, you must be at least 13 years old, complying with
        applicable laws such as COPPA. If you are under 18, you must have
        permission from a parent or guardian. We do not knowingly collect
        personal information from children without consent and may suspend or
        delete accounts if unauthorized use is detected.
    </p>
    <p>
        Parents and guardians are encouraged to supervise their children’s
        online activity. Although our platform provides tools to promote privacy
        and safety, adults play a vital role in ensuring a secure experience for
        minors. If you have questions about supervising accounts, please reach
        out to our support team.
    </p>

    <h2 id="what-to-expect">3. What You Can Expect from Us</h2>
    <p>
        We strive to provide a reliable, secure, and privacy-conscious service.
        Zunalita Blog is regularly updated to improve functionality, security,
        and user experience. We aim to keep downtime minimal and inform you of
        any major maintenance or outages through announcements.
    </p>
    <p>
        Your privacy is fundamental. We handle your data according to our
        Privacy Policy, which explains what we collect, how we use it, and your
        rights. We never sell your personal data, and we apply strong
        protections against unauthorized access. Please contact us with any
        privacy concerns.
    </p>

    <h2 id="your-account">4. Your Account</h2>
    <p>
        You are responsible for maintaining your account credentials and
        ensuring all information you provide is accurate and up-to-date. Please
        notify us immediately if you suspect unauthorized use of your account.
    </p>
    <p>
        We recommend using strong, unique passwords and enabling additional
        security features when possible. While we implement robust protections,
        we cannot be held responsible for losses caused by user negligence. Use
        best practices to keep your account secure.
    </p>

    <h2 id="content">5. Content on Our Services</h2>
    <h3 id="your-content">Your Content</h3>
    <p>
        You retain ownership of all content you create and share on Zunalita
        Blog. By posting, you grant us a limited license to display, host, and
        distribute your content in connection with providing our services. This
        license ends when you remove the content or delete your account, except
        where retention is legally required.
    </p>
    <p>
        Please ensure your content complies with all laws and does not infringe
        on others’ rights. We may remove any material that violates these terms
        or community guidelines. You can report violations via our contact form.
    </p>

    <h3 id="service-content">Service Content</h3>
    <p>
        Content created or licensed by Zunalita Blog — such as layouts,
        graphics, and editorial text — is protected by intellectual property
        laws. You may not copy, distribute, or modify such content without our
        explicit consent.
    </p>
    <p>
        We aim to keep our service content accurate and up-to-date but cannot
        guarantee it will always be free of errors. Please report inaccuracies
        so we can correct them promptly.
    </p>

    <h3 id="other-content">Other Content</h3>
    <p>
        You may encounter content created by other users or third parties. We do
        not endorse or verify the accuracy of such content and disclaim
        responsibility for it. Use caution and report anything you believe
        violates these terms.
    </p>
    <p>
        We reserve the right to remove, restrict, or block access to third-party
        or user-generated content as needed for legal compliance or community
        safety.
    </p>

    <h2 id="software">6. Software in Our Services</h2>

        Zunalita Blog may use proprietary or open-source software to operate the
        platform. By using our services, you agree to comply with all applicable
        software licenses. Unauthorized copying, reverse engineering, or
        distribution of the software is prohibited.
    </p>
    <p>
        We periodically update our software to improve features and security.
        Updates may occur automatically and without prior notice to maintain
        service quality and user safety.
    </p>

    <h2 id="copyrights">7. Copyrights</h2>
    <p>
        If you believe your copyrighted material has been infringed on Zunalita
        Blog, please submit a detailed notice. We comply with DMCA takedown
        requests and similar laws to protect intellectual property.
    </p>
    <p>
        Upon receiving a valid complaint, we will investigate promptly and
        remove infringing content when appropriate. Repeat offenders may face
        account suspension or termination.
    </p>

    <h2 id="paid-services">8. Paid Services</h2>
    <p>
        Zunalita Blog offers some premium features or subscriptions for a fee.
        Details of pricing, payment options, and refund policies are clearly
        outlined during checkout. Payments are processed securely in line with
        our Privacy Policy.
    </p>
    <p>
        We may modify prices or discontinue paid services, but we will notify
        you in advance whenever feasible. Refunds are subject to applicable laws
        and our stated policy.
    </p>

    <h2 id="restrictions">9. Restrictions on Use</h2>
    <p>
        Users must comply with all applicable laws and avoid any activity that
        disrupts or harms others. Prohibited conduct includes harassment,
        spamming, distributing malware, or attempting unauthorized access to
        systems or accounts.
    </p>
    <p>
        Violations may result in suspension, termination, or legal action. We
        reserve the right to enforce these terms to protect the integrity of our
        community.
    </p>

    <h2 id="termination">10. Termination</h2>
    <p>
        We may suspend or terminate your account at our discretion for
        violations, inactivity, or other reasons. Upon termination, your rights
        to use the service cease immediately, but certain obligations remain.
    </p>
    <p>
        We will retain some information as required by law or to protect our
        interests. You may request deletion of personal data consistent with our
        Privacy Policy and legal obligations.
    </p>

    <h2 id="features">11. Features</h2>
    <p>
        Zunalita Blog continuously evolves and adds new features. While we aim
        to keep you informed of changes, we do not guarantee that any feature
        will remain available permanently.
    </p>
    <p>
        For questions about feature changes or removals, please reach out to our
        support team. We value your feedback in shaping future development.

        You agree to indemnify and hold harmless Zunalita Blog, its affiliates,
        and staff from any claims, damages, or expenses arising from your use of
        our services or your violation of these terms.
    </p>
    <p>
        This obligation survives the termination of your account and applies
        regardless of the source of the claim, including other users, third
        parties, or regulatory agencies.
    </p>

    <h2 id="as-is">13. “AS IS” Services</h2>
    <p>
        We provide our services on an “AS IS” and “AS AVAILABLE” basis, without
        warranties of any kind. You assume all risks associated with using our
        platform, and we disclaim all liability for potential damages.
    </p>
    <p>
        We do not guarantee uninterrupted service, perfect accuracy, or complete
        security and are not liable for losses resulting from your use of the
        services.
    </p>

    <h2 id="mobile-charges">14. Mobile Data Charges</h2>
    <p>
        Your use of Zunalita Blog may incur mobile data costs from your
        provider. We are not responsible for these charges. Monitor your usage

    <p>
        Our total liability is limited to the amount you paid us in the six

    </p>

    <h2 id="disputes">16. Dispute Resolution</h2>
    <p>
